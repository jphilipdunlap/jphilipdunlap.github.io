The U.S.-Israel relationship extracts a price far beyond foreign policy debates. Since October 7, 2023, American taxpayers have funded **$16.3 billion** in direct military aid to Israel—money that cycles through defense contractors, shapes domestic policing practices, and restricts constitutional speech rights. Cumulatively, the United States has provided [**$310 billion** in inflation-adjusted assistance](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf) since 1948, making Israel the largest cumulative recipient of U.S. foreign aid in history. But the costs extend beyond dollars: from surveillance technologies tested on Palestinians now deployed in American cities, to anti-boycott laws that have become templates for silencing climate activists, to donated human bodies used for foreign military training without families' knowledge.

This investigation examines what the alliance costs ordinary Americans—financially, constitutionally, and in ways that may never appear on any balance sheet.

## The Bill: $3.8 Billion Annually, With Emergency Additions

The financial architecture of U.S. military aid to Israel operates through the [2016 Memorandum of Understanding](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/09/14/fact-sheet-memorandum-understanding-reached-israel), signed during the Obama administration. This agreement commits **$38 billion over ten years** (FY2019-2028), breaking down to **$3.3 billion** in Foreign Military Financing and **$500 million** for cooperative missile defense programs annually. The White House called it "the single largest pledge of bilateral military assistance in U.S. history."

The October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks triggered the largest supplemental package ever directed to Israel. The [**April 2024 supplemental**](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/8035) (P.L. 118-50) allocated approximately **$8.7 billion** specifically for Israel: $3.5 billion in additional FMF, $4 billion for missile defense systems including Iron Dome and David's Sling, and $1.2 billion for the first-ever U.S. funding of the Iron Beam laser defense system. Combined with regular appropriations, [**total U.S. military aid enacted since October 2023 exceeds $16.3 billion**](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf)—and that figure excludes classified transfers and expedited commercial sales.

The physical scale matches the financial commitment. According to the [Israeli Defense Ministry](https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-says-us-has-sent-500-cargo-planes-107-ships-carrying-arms-equipment-since-oct-7/), the United States has delivered **90,000 tons of arms and equipment** via 800 transport planes and 140 ships since October 2023. Within days of the initial conflict, 1,000 GBU-39 Small Diameter Bombs were picked up directly by Israeli aircraft. Tens of thousands of additional bombs, artillery shells, and precision-guided munitions followed.

### How the Money Cycles Back to American Contractors

Foreign Military Financing isn't charity to Israel—it's a subsidy to the American defense industry. Under the current MOU, Israel's ability to spend FMF on domestically-produced weapons is being phased out: from 26.3% in FY2019 to [zero by FY2028](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf). This means **100% of the $3.8 billion annual commitment will flow directly to U.S. defense contractors** within three years.

Israel receives FMF uniquely: in a lump sum within 30 days of appropriation, rather than the monthly disbursements other countries receive. The funds sit in U.S. bank accounts, generating interest for Israel while awaiting procurement. Through a ["cash flow financing" arrangement](https://www.cfr.org/article/us-aid-israel-four-charts), Israel can commit future FMF allocations to current purchases—banks pay Lockheed Martin or Boeing upfront, with Israel repaying using future-year aid. The F-35 program, for instance, is financed through a Citibank consortium under this structure.

The [Defense Security Cooperation Agency](https://www.dsca.mil/) currently tracks **751 active Foreign Military Sales cases with Israel valued at $39.2 billion**. In August 2024 alone, the State Department notified Congress of over $20 billion in potential sales, including up to 50 F-15IA fighter jets. The February 2025 Trump Administration emergency declaration authorized approximately $4 billion in additional sales, bypassing standard congressional review.

### What the Money Could Buy at Home

The **$3.8 billion annual MOU commitment** could employ approximately **53,000 teachers** at the [national average salary of $72,030](https://www.nea.org/resource-library/educator-pay-and-student-spending-how-does-your-state-rank), or 81,000 beginning teachers at the average starting salary of $46,526. It would nearly double the Child Care Development Block Grant ($8.7 billion in FY2024), or fund education for approximately 244,000 students at the national per-pupil expenditure of $15,591.

The **$16.3 billion committed since October 2023** represents the equivalent of 226,000 teacher salaries for one year, or over four years of Maryland's landmark $3.8 billion annual education reform initiative. It could construct roughly 54,000 affordable housing units at $300,000 per unit. For context, [77% of U.S. school districts](https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/average-teacher-pay-passes-70k-how-much-is-it-in-your-state/2024/05) currently pay beginning teachers less than $50,000 annually.

These comparisons aren't hypothetical trade-offs—they illuminate a set of priorities. Since 2021, over 99% of U.S. aid to Israel has been military assistance. The days of significant economic aid ended decades ago; what remains is an arrangement where American tax dollars purchase American weapons to supply a foreign military, enriching a specific sector of the American economy while bypassing domestic needs entirely.

## The Beneficiaries: Defense Contractors and the Iron Triangle

Five corporations dominate Israel-related military contracts: **Lockheed Martin, RTX (formerly Raytheon), Boeing, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman**. Together, these companies received approximately [$771 billion in Pentagon contracts](https://www.taxpayer.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Oct-2024-Political-Footprint-of-the-Military-Industry.pdf) between 2020 and 2024. Their Israel-related business represents a significant and growing portion.

**Lockheed Martin** leads with the F-35 program. Israel has ordered 75 F-35I Adir stealth fighters, with 45 delivered as of 2025 at approximately $100 million each. The company reported $5.5 billion in Middle East sales since October 2023, according to SEC filings. Its aeronautics division generated $28.6 billion in 2024 revenues, while the Missiles and Fire Control segment—producing Hellfire missiles and MLRS systems—brought in $12.68 billion, a 13% year-over-year increase.

**RTX/Raytheon** anchors the missile defense relationship. Through its R2S joint venture with Israel's Rafael, RTX co-produces the Iron Dome system, which maintains a 95%+ interception rate. A **$1.25 billion contract** announced in November 2025 supplies Tamir surface-to-air missiles, with production at a new $33 million facility in East Camden, Arkansas. The company has secured **$6 billion in Middle East weapons sales** since October 2023, supplying cluster bombs, bunker busters, and guided missiles.

**Boeing** won the largest single contract: **$8.57 billion** (January 2026) for 25 F-15IA jets with an option for 25 additional aircraft. The company also supplies JDAM guidance kits—approximately 3,000 delivered between 2021-2023, with new contracts totaling over $1.1 billion including a June 2025 deal for 7,000+ additional kits. Boeing's defense division accounts for 36% of total company sales ($23.9 billion in 2024) with a $64 billion military backlog.

**General Dynamics** secured an **$774.1 million contract** (August 2024) for 32,739 120mm tank cartridges for Israel's Merkava tanks—including M1147 HEMP-T and M830A1 MPAT rounds. The company also manufactures MK-80 bomb bodies at its Garland, Texas facility and produces 20mm and 25mm guns for fighter aircraft.

**Northrop Grumman** partners on the Arrow missile system and the $774 million tank ammunition contract. The company spent [$10.86 million on lobbying in 2023](https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/clients/summary?cycle=2023&id=D000000170), with 29 of its 36 registered lobbyists being "revolving door" hires from government positions.

### The Revolving Door Spins

The relationship between the Pentagon, defense contractors, and Congress operates through personnel who cycle between sectors. A [2023 Senate report](https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/DoD%20Revolving%20Door%20Report.pdf) found **672 instances** of the top 20 defense contractors employing former government officials, with 91% becoming registered lobbyists. At least [380 high-ranking DoD officials](https://www.pogo.org/reports/brass-parachutes) shifted to the private sector in recent years; the 36 individuals who left the Pentagon for defense firms in 2021 alone joined companies that received **$89.3 billion** in contracts that year.

The pattern is consistent across companies. Boeing has employed 85 former officials (77 as lobbyists, 6 as executives, 2 on its board). Raytheon absorbed 64 (60 lobbyists, 1 executive, 3 board members). General Dynamics hired 57; Lockheed Martin 53. High-profile examples include Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin (former Raytheon board member), Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan (former Boeing executive), and Defense Secretary James Mattis (former General Dynamics board member).

The financial pipeline flows both directions. The defense sector spent [**$139 million on lobbying in 2023**](https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/sectors/summary?cycle=2023&id=D)—averaging $381,260 daily—through 904 registered lobbyists. Since 2003, the industry has spent [$2.7 billion on lobbying and $374 million in campaign contributions](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2023/05/revolving-door-lobbyists-help-defense-contractors-get-off-to-strong-start-in-2023). In the 2020 election cycle alone, defense sector contributions totaled $50 million, split 57% Republican and 43% Democratic, with disproportionate targeting of Armed Services and Appropriations Committee members.

## The Blowback: How Israeli Tactics Come Home

The costs of the U.S.-Israel alliance extend beyond budgets into policing practices, surveillance technologies, and crowd control methods. Since 1992, thousands of American law enforcement officials have traveled to Israel for training programs that critics characterize as a ["deadly exchange"](https://deadlyexchange.org/)—where tactics developed in the context of military occupation are repackaged for American domestic use.

### Training Programs That Send Police to Israel

The [**Georgia International Law Enforcement Exchange (GILEE)**](https://gilee.gsu.edu/), founded in 1992 at Georgia State University in preparation for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, has trained over [**1,300 law enforcement executives**](https://gilee.gsu.edu/about/partnerships/law-enforcement-2/graduates/) through 31 annual delegations to Israel. More than 45,000 public safety officials have participated in GILEE-led briefings and workshops. Funding comes from U.S. Department of Justice grants and private donations—billionaire Home Depot co-founder Bernard Marcus provided at least $1.25 million between 2005 and 2022. Every Atlanta police chief has participated.

The **Anti-Defamation League's National Counter-Terrorism Seminar** has trained over **1,000 senior law enforcement officials** from nearly 200 federal, state, and local agencies since 2004. The week-long program includes briefings with Israel National Police, training with IDF units, and sessions with Shin Bet intelligence services. According to ADL, "almost every major city police department in the country" has participated.

A [leaked 2020 internal ADL memo](https://mondoweiss.net/2016/01/enforcement-training-terrorism/) revealed senior executives questioning the program during George Floyd protests: "In light of the very real police brutality at the hands of militarized police forces in the US, we must ask ourselves difficult questions, like whether we are contributing to the problem." The memo asked "whether, upon returning home, those we train are more likely to use force." The program has been paused since 2019.

The NYPD maintains the closest documented relationship. The department has operated a branch in Israel since at least 2012, housed at Sharon District Police Headquarters in Kfar Saba. Commissioners Ray Kelly, Bill Bratton, and James O'Neill all participated in exchange programs. The department's **Demographics Unit**—established after 9/11 to surveil Muslim communities—was "inspired in part by Israeli practices in the Occupied Territories," according to [Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists Matt Apuzzo and Adam Goldman](https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/matt-apuzzo-and-adam-goldman-associated-press).

The Demographics Unit deployed plainclothes "rakers" to Muslim neighborhoods to "blend in consistent with their ethnicity," sent "mosque crawlers" to report on sermons and photograph attendees, and compiled files on where Muslims "ate, prayed and shopped." In 2012 sworn testimony, Assistant Chief Thomas Galati admitted the unit **"never led to a single lead or investigation"** during his six years commanding it. The unit was disbanded in 2014.

### Surveillance Technologies from Israel to America

[**Cellebrite**](https://cellebrite.com/), the Israeli digital intelligence company, manufactures phone extraction devices used by law enforcement agencies across the United States. Its Universal Forensic Extraction Device (UFED) can access locked smartphones, retrieve "deleted" data, map location history, and compare facial images across phone contents. The FBI has signed **187 contracts** with Cellebrite over seven years. Immigration and Customs Enforcement contracts have totaled **$30-35 million**. The FBI used Cellebrite to access the phone of the July 2024 Trump assassination attempt suspect.

[**NSO Group**](https://www.nsogroup.com/), the Israeli cyber-intelligence firm, produces **Pegasus spyware**—a "zero-click" surveillance tool that can remotely access smartphone microphones, cameras, messages, and location data without user interaction. The Israeli government classifies Pegasus as a military export. Almost all NSO research staff are former Israeli military intelligence personnel, primarily from Unit 8200. The FBI [secretly purchased Pegasus in 2019](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/28/magazine/nso-group-israel-spyware.html) and tested a version capable of targeting U.S. phone numbers before deciding against operational use in 2021. The equipment remains at an FBI facility in New Jersey. The [U.S. Commerce Department blacklisted NSO](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/11/commerce-adds-nso-group-and-other-foreign-companies-entity-list) in November 2021.

**BriefCam**, an Israeli video analytics company now owned by Canon, provides facial recognition and surveillance platforms to dozens of American cities. Its systems filter video by "men, women, children, clothing, bags, vehicles, animals, size, color, speed, path, direction, dwell time" and include "Watch List" functionality for tracking specific individuals.

### Crowd Control Equipment Moves from Hebron to Ferguson

**"Skunk"** is a malodorant liquid weapon developed by Israeli company Odortec in collaboration with Israeli police. The compound produces an overwhelming odor described as "rotting animal carcass, raw sewage and human excrement," sticks to surfaces for days to weeks, and cannot be removed without special soap available only to police. It was **"field-tested" on Palestinians** in the villages of Bil'in and Ni'lin in 2008—described by an Israeli official as "monitored exercises."

Three months after the Ferguson uprising, the [**St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department** purchased Skunk](https://reason.com/2022/06/20/do-small-town-cops-need-training-in-israeli-counterterror-techniques/) from Mistral Security, the Bethesda, Maryland distributor: 14 canisters at $428, plus larger refillable containers. Tim Fitch, St. Louis County Police Chief during the Ferguson protests, had trained in Israel through the ADL three years earlier.

The Transportation Security Administration's **SPOT (Screening Passengers by Observation Techniques)** program directly derives from Israeli airport security methods. Developed by Rafi Ron, former security director at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport, SPOT deployed over 3,000 "Behavior Detection Officers" at more than 161 airports to identify suspicious travelers through behavioral observation. The program has cost over **$1 billion** since 2007. [Government Accountability Office reports](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-10-763) found "no scientific evidence exists to support the detection or inference of future behavior, including intent." Over **150,000 travelers** have been referred for secondary screening. **Zero have been terrorists.**

## The Silencing: Anti-BDS Laws and the First Amendment

**Thirty-eight states** have enacted anti-BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) laws or executive orders requiring contractors to certify they do not boycott Israel. These laws have generated First Amendment challenges, constitutional rulings, and—perhaps most consequentially—a legislative template now being deployed to protect the fossil fuel and firearms industries from consumer activism.

The cases share a pattern. **Bahia Amawi**, a speech pathologist and the only certified Arabic-speaking therapist in Texas's Pflugerville Independent School District, lost her job in September 2018 after refusing to sign an anti-boycott certification. She had worked with developmentally disabled and autistic children for nine years. **Esther Koontz**, a Kansas math curriculum coach and Mennonite following her church's call to boycott, lost a contracting opportunity with the state Department of Education. **Alan Leveritt**, publisher of the [Arkansas Times](https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2023/02/21/supreme-court-leaves-arkansas-anti-bds-law-in-place), refused on principle despite his newspaper taking no position on BDS—and faced a 20% penalty on state advertising contracts.

Federal district courts have found these laws unconstitutional in **Kansas** (*Koontz v. Watson*, 2018), **Texas** (*Amawi v. Pflugerville ISD*, 2019), **Arizona** (*Jordahl v. Brnovich*, 2018), and **Georgia** (*Martin v. Georgia Southern University*, 2021). Judge Robert Pitman's 56-page Texas ruling called the law a threat that "suppresses unpopular ideas and manipulates the public debate on Israel and Palestine."

However, the [**Eighth Circuit sitting en banc**](https://www.aclu.org/cases/arkansas-times-lp-v-waldrip) ruled 9-1 in 2022 that Arkansas's law is constitutional, holding that it "prohibits purely commercial, non-expressive conduct." The Supreme Court [**denied certiorari**](https://reason.com/volokh/2023/02/21/s-ct-denies-review-of-eighth-circuit-en-banc-case-upholding-arkansas-anti-bds-statute/) in February 2023, leaving a circuit split unresolved. Arkansas Times publisher Leveritt responded: "The Supreme Court can ignore our First Amendment rights but we will continue to vigorously exercise them."

### The Template Spreads Beyond Israel

The anti-BDS legislative model has been explicitly adapted for other industries. Texas serves as the template origin: after passing HB 89 (anti-BDS) in 2017, the state enacted **SB 13** (fossil fuel protection) in 2021 with virtually identical structure—requiring contractors with 10+ employees and $100,000+ contracts to certify they don't boycott fossil fuels and creating a "blacklist" of divesting financial institutions.

**Jason Isaac**, the Texas Republican legislator who co-authored the anti-BDS law, explicitly stated the anti-BDS bill was "the inspiration" for the fossil fuel protection measure.

The [**American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)**](https://alec.org/) proposed model legislation—the "Energy Discrimination Elimination Act"—in December 2021. By 2023, **165 distinct anti-ESG bills** had been introduced across 37 states, with 14 states enacting legislation. Alabama's 2023 law prohibits contracts unless companies certify they don't boycott fossil fuels, mining, agriculture, timber, or firearms.

The **Heritage Foundation's model** "Eliminate Economic Boycotts Act" extends further, requiring contractors to certify they won't boycott fossil fuels, timber, mining, agriculture, firearms, ammunition, and accessories, or make decisions based on ESG criteria. Civil liberties advocates call this ["the Palestine exception to the First Amendment"](https://www.rightsanddissent.org/news/arkansas-times-boycott-supreme-court-sleeps-on-defending-right-to-political-expression/)—where free speech protections are systematically not applied to one cause, establishing precedent that spreads to others.

## The Bodies: Donated Remains Used for Foreign Military Training

A 2025 investigation by [**USC Annenberg Media**](https://www.uscannenbergmedia.com/2025/10/01/usc-sold-dead-bodies-to-us-military-to-train-idf-medical-personnel/) student journalists revealed that the University of Southern California has received over **$860,000** from the U.S. Navy for at least **89 human cadavers** since 2017. Of those, **32 bodies** were used specifically for training Israeli Defense Forces medical personnel.

The contracts are explicit. A 2023 agreement provided **$516,632** for "cadavers for IDF training" with potential for an additional $224,636 through September 2026—totaling approximately $1.1 million. Contracts from 2021 and 2023 required USC to provide 12 "fresh tissue cadaver bodies" per year for IDF training, with each course using 3 cadavers.

The **Navy Trauma Training Center**, established in 2002 at LA General Medical Center through a military-civilian partnership, uses "perfused cadavers"—bodies pumped with artificial blood to simulate live patients—for surgical training. IDF-specific courses began in 2013. According to Navy documentation, the purpose is training IDF "non-combatant surgeons, nurses and anesthesiologists" who cannot touch live patients due to "credentialing issues."

### Consent and the Question of Knowledge

USC's Anatomical Gift Program consent form grants the Keck School of Medicine authority to use remains for "teaching, research or such purposes as USC shall, in its sole discretion, deem advisable." No specific mention of military training or foreign military use appears. University of California San Diego, another documented body source, similarly describes remains used for "medical training and research" without specificity.

A 2020 medical paper co-authored by USC and Navy surgeons initially claimed bodies came from the LA County Office of Decedent Affairs, which handles unclaimed remains. In January 2026, [LA Health Services stated](https://www.uscannenbergmedia.com/2026/01/25/usc-navy-extend-contract-to-provide-cadavers-to-idf-for-training/) this was **"incorrect and false"**—LA County "has never provided cadavers for foreign military training."

Thomas Champney, a University of Miami anatomy professor, told investigators: "Even though they're deceased, they still deserve a level of respect and dignity and proper treatment that we would normally give to the living." He noted that "unlike organ donation, there's little to no regulation on the use of anatomical bodies." The American Association for Anatomy issued December 2024 guidelines deeming the use of unclaimed bodies unethical and requiring programs to "clearly and transparently document the intended use" through informed consent.

**No lawsuits have been filed** as of January 2026. No government investigations have been announced. The Navy [**extended the contract in September 2025**](https://www.uscannenbergmedia.com/2026/01/25/usc-navy-extend-contract-to-provide-cadavers-to-idf-for-training/), providing over $200,000 for additional bodies through September 2026. USC has not stated whether it will end IDF collaborations after the current contract expires.

The L.A. General physician housestaff union condemned the practice: "It is unacceptable that our public hospitals and institutions, which are designed to serve our most vulnerable communities, are instead engaged in the exploitation of our patients to support the training of military personnel."

---

## Costs That Compound

The U.S.-Israel alliance operates through mechanisms that distribute costs in ways most Americans never see. The **$310 billion** in cumulative inflation-adjusted aid represents opportunity costs—teachers unhired, infrastructure unbuilt, healthcare unfunded. The **$16.3 billion** committed since October 2023 cycles through defense contractors whose executives rotate through government positions, whose lobbyists shape policy, and whose shareholders include public pension funds.

Beyond dollars, the alliance transfers methods. Surveillance technologies tested on Palestinians appear in American cities. Crowd control weapons "field-tested" in the West Bank are purchased by American police. Training programs send officers to learn from forces whose primary experience is occupation. Behavioral profiling systems inspired by Israeli airport security produce zero terrorist identifications while generating 150,000 secondary screenings at American airports.

The legal architecture of anti-BDS laws has demonstrated something perhaps more lasting than any individual policy: that rights can be conditioned, that speech can be penalized through economic leverage, and that templates for restriction spread. What began as legislation targeting Palestine solidarity has been explicitly adapted to silence climate activists and protect firearms manufacturers from consumer pressure.

The price of the U.S.-Israel alliance cannot be captured in a single figure. It accumulates in appropriations and contracts, in training programs and technology transfers, in consent forms that don't specify and constitutional rights that bend. It is paid by taxpayers who fund the weapons, by communities surveilled with imported methods, by speakers forced to certify political positions for public contracts, and by the families of those whose bodies were used for purposes they never knew.

The question is not whether these costs exist—the documentation is extensive. The question is whether Americans understand what they are paying, and whether that price is one they choose to bear.

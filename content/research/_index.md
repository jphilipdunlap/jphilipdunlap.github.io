My research focuses on institutional accountability, public finance, and the mechanisms by which public institutions become captured by interests that conflict with their stated missions. I build evidentiary records from primary sources—board documents, internal communications, statutory frameworks—and translate complex regulatory failures into clear findings.

## Featured Investigation

### [The Pension Pipeline](/research/pension-pipeline/)

**How Political Capture and Ideology Breached the Trust of Arkansas Teachers**

A forensic investigation into how the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System Board breached its fiduciary duty through a politically-driven $50 million Israel Bond investment and the strategic hiring of an ideological proxy advisor.

Based on hundreds of pages of internal documents, emails, and public records obtained through FOIA requests, this investigation documents:

- A multi-month political influence campaign led by State Auditor Dennis Milligan
- Coordination between state officials and the national State Financial Officers Foundation network
- Circumvention of the Board's own due diligence requirements
- Ignored credit downgrades from S&P Global Ratings
- The weaponization of "anti-ESG" compliance to embed partisan ideology in pension governance

## Methodology

I conduct FOIA-based investigations that build comprehensive evidentiary records from primary sources: board minutes, financial disclosures, internal correspondence, and statutory frameworks.

The goal is documentation rigorous enough to hold up to legal scrutiny—the kind of record that transforms advocacy from assertion into evidence.

I've developed training materials on federal and Arkansas FOIA processes for activist organizations seeking to use public records as tools for accountability campaigns.

## Ongoing Work

Additional research on Arkansas defense industry supply chains and corporate-political networks is in development.

If you're working on related investigations—particularly around state pension capture, anti-ESG coordination, or defense industry complicity—I'm interested in collaboration.

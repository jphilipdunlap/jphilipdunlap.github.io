My research focuses on institutional accountability and the mechanisms by which public institutions become captured by interests that conflict with their stated missions. I build evidentiary records from primary sources—board documents, internal communications, campaign finance data, statutory frameworks—and translate complex systems into clear findings.

## Featured Investigations

### [The Algorithmic Kill Chain](/research/algorithmic-kill-chain/)

**Documenting AI-Driven Violence Against Palestinians**

A six-part investigation into the integrated system of AI targeting and surveillance deployed by Israel in Gaza and the occupied territories. The series traces the complete kill chain: from Lavender's mass target generation to The Gospel's infrastructure targeting to Where's Daddy?'s home-tracking automation—and the corporate infrastructure from Google, Amazon, and Israeli tech firms that makes it all possible.

**How Political Capture and Ideology Breached the Trust of Arkansas Teachers**

A forensic investigation into how the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System Board breached its fiduciary duty through a politically-driven $50 million Israel Bond investment and the strategic hiring of an ideological proxy advisor. Based on hundreds of pages of internal documents obtained through FOIA requests.

**Mapping the Supply Chain to Documented Violations of International Humanitarian Law**

A comprehensive investigation tracing Arkansas defense manufacturing to documented civilian casualties—including the $133,500 in Lockheed Martin PAC contributions to Arkansas's federal delegation, the political networks enabling weapons transfers, and the protective legislation shielding Israel from accountability.

## Methodology

I conduct FOIA-based investigations that build comprehensive evidentiary records from primary sources: board minutes, financial disclosures, internal correspondence, campaign finance records, and statutory frameworks.

The goal is documentation rigorous enough to hold up to legal scrutiny—the kind of record that transforms advocacy from assertion into evidence.

I've developed training materials on federal and Arkansas FOIA processes for activist organizations seeking to use public records as tools for accountability campaigns.

## Ongoing Work

If you're working on related investigations—particularly around state pension capture, anti-ESG coordination, or defense industry complicity—I'm interested in collaboration.

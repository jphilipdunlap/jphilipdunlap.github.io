## Executive Summary

The state of Arkansas functions as a critical node in the military-industrial supply chain to the Israeli armed forces. This is not incidental—it is the product of deliberate political strategy, formalized agreements, and a self-reinforcing system of corporate investment, campaign financing, and public subsidy.

Four of the world's largest defense contractors operate "centers of excellence" in and around Camden, Arkansas, producing missile systems, rocket motors, and munitions that are transferred to Israel through U.S. foreign military financing. A direct, evidence-based line runs from the factory floors of southern Arkansas to documented allegations of serious violations of international humanitarian law.

This investigation traces that line. It maps the industrial base, documents the political architecture that sustains it, compiles the financial relationships between defense contractors and Arkansas politicians, and connects specific weapon systems to specific incidents investigated by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.

The evidence demonstrates that Arkansas's role as an "arsenal" is not mere political rhetoric—it is an operational reality with profound human consequences.

## The Camden Nexus: Arkansas's Weapons Production Hub

The foundation of Arkansas's role in the global arms trade lies in the extraordinary concentration of defense manufacturing capabilities within the Highland Industrial Park in East Camden. This sprawling complex—a legacy of the World War II-era Shumaker Naval Ammunition Depot—has been transformed into a high-tech production center for some of the United States' most critical and widely exported weapon systems.

### The Four Pillars

Four prime defense contractors anchor the Camden defense nexus. Their operations here are designated as corporate "centers of excellence," making Camden indispensable to the U.S. military's global supply chain.

**Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control**

Lockheed Martin's Camden Operations occupies over 2,400 acres with more than 2.2 million square feet of manufacturing space. The facility is the company's "[center of excellence for Precision Fires](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/business-areas/missiles-and-fire-control/camden.html)" and serves as the primary production site for:

- **High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)** launchers—production doubled to 96 units annually in late 2024
- **Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS)** rockets—annual capacity target of 14,000 by 2025
- **Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE)**—the sole U.S. production site, with capacity increasing to 650 missiles annually by 2027
- **Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS)** long-range missiles
- **Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)** launchers and fire control units

**RTX (Raytheon) / Rafael Joint Venture**

In a [$33 million facility](https://www.rtx.com/news/news-center/2023/10/26/rtx-rafael-to-build-missile-production-facility-in-camden-arkansas), RTX and Israel's state-owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems are building the first U.S.-based production site for the Iron Dome Weapon System. The Raytheon-Rafael Area Protection Systems (R2S) plant produces:

- **Tamir interceptor missiles** for Israel's Iron Dome system
- **SkyHunter® missiles**—the U.S. variant for the Marine Corps' Medium Range Intercept Capability program

This facility represents a physical manifestation of the U.S.-Israel military alliance on Arkansas soil, directly linking the state's economy to the defense infrastructure of a foreign nation.

**L3Harris Technologies**

As its corporate "[Center of Excellence](https://www.l3harris.com/newsroom/press-release/2025/07/l3Harris-expand-solid-rocket-motor-production-arkansas)" for solid rocket motors, L3Harris's Camden campus manufactures over 100,000 propulsion units annually. A **$193 million expansion** announced in July 2025 will increase manufacturing capacity for Large Solid Rocket Motors six-fold. The facility produces propulsion systems for:

- **Javelin** anti-tank missiles
- **Stinger** anti-aircraft missiles
- **GMLRS** rockets
- **PAC-3** interceptors
- Next-generation hypersonic vehicles

**General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems**

General Dynamics operates multiple facilities specializing in explosives, warheads, and the load, assemble, and pack (LAP) process that integrates warheads into munitions. A new [$110 million facility](https://www.arkansasedc.com/news-events/newsroom/detail/2025/04/23/general-dynamics-u.s.-army-open-new-155mm-artillery-facility-in-calhoun-county-arkansas) opened in April 2025 for 155mm artillery production. Products include:

- Warheads for **AGM-114 Hellfire** missiles
- Warheads for **FGM-148 Javelin** missiles
- **Hydra-70** rockets
- **155mm artillery projectiles**
- Energetic materials for **MK-84 (2,000-lb) bomb bodies**

## The Political Architecture

The defense industry's concentration in Arkansas is not an accident of geography or market forces. It is the result of deliberate political strategy enacted at the highest levels of state government—a strategy that has moved beyond business recruitment to the creation of a formalized strategic partnership with the State of Israel.

### Gubernatorial Diplomacy

Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders has made the expansion of aerospace and defense manufacturing a central plank of her economic agenda. Her administration has led multiple international trade missions with the explicit purpose of deepening Arkansas's role in the global arms industry.

At the 2023 Paris Air Show, Governor Sanders met with RTX executives to finalize the Iron Dome production facility. At its groundbreaking, she declared: "Our world is a whole lot less secure than it used to be, and this facility makes our country safer."

A subsequent meeting at the Paris Air Show with the CEO of L3Harris was [publicly credited](https://www.arkansasedc.com/news-events/newsroom/detail/2025/07/17/l3Harris-to-build-more-than-20-new-large-solid-rocket-motor-manufacturing-facilities-in-calhoun-county--arkansas) as the catalyst for the company's $193 million expansion announcement.

In August 2025, Governor Sanders led a trade mission to Israel and the UAE, culminating in the signing of a [Memorandum of Understanding](https://governor.arkansas.gov/news_post/sanders-signs-economic-cooperation-agreement-between-the-state-of-arkansas-and-the-national-technological-innovation-authority-of-the-state-of-israel/) with Israel's National Technological Innovation Authority. The MOU explicitly identifies **"aerospace and defense"** as a primary "strategic technological field" for joint research, development, and commercialization.

Governor Sanders has proudly declared her intention to position "Arkansas as the arsenal of democracy."

### The Financial Feedback Loop

This political architecture is reinforced by a steady stream of campaign contributions flowing from defense contractor political action committees to Arkansas's federal delegation—contributions that are met with vocal public advocacy and favorable policy outcomes.

**Lockheed Martin PAC Contributions to Arkansas Politicians (2020-2023)**

| Recipient | Amount | Position |
|:----------|-------:|:---------|
| Sen. John Boozman | $30,000 | Senate Appropriations Committee |
| Sen. Tom Cotton | $20,000 | Senate Armed Services Committee |
| Rep. French Hill | $20,000 | House Financial Services Committee |
| Rep. Steve Womack | $20,000 | House Appropriations Committee |
| Rep. Bruce Westerman | $15,000 | House Natural Resources Committee |

*Source: [Lockheed Martin Political Disclosures](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/leadership-governance/board-of-directors/political-disclosures.html) and [OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/lockheed-martin/C00303024/pac-to-pac/2024)*

These contributions correlate with consistent advocacy. Representative Bruce Westerman has publicly championed the defense facilities in his district, [declaring](https://swark.today/articles/investing-in-the-future-of-americas-defense) that "Camden has rightfully earned its place as one of the nation's preeminent defense manufacturing hubs."

### Legislative Infrastructure

Arkansas has enacted legislation creating a favorable environment for the defense industry and limiting advocacy for divestment:

**Act 710 of 2017 (Anti-BDS Law):** Prohibits state entities from contracting with companies that boycott Israel. The [Arkansas Times](https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Acts/Document?type=pdf&act=710&ddBienniumSession=2017/2017R) challenged the law in federal court; portions were enjoined as unconstitutional restrictions on speech before a settlement.

**Act 721 of 2025 (IHRA Antisemitism Definition):** [Codifies](https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/Detail?id=SB352&ddBienniumSession=2025%2F2025R) the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's working definition of antisemitism into state law. Critics argue the definition's "contemporary examples" conflate criticism of Israeli government policy with antisemitism, potentially chilling advocacy for Palestinian rights.

## The End-Use Question: From Arkansas to Civilian Casualties

The weapons produced in Camden do not remain abstract industrial products. They are transferred to foreign militaries, including the Israeli Defense Forces, where they have been documented by international human rights organizations in attacks resulting in civilian deaths.

### Documented Weapons Transfers

The Defense Security Cooperation Agency has [notified Congress](https://media.defense.gov/2025/Mar/03/2003653983/-1/-1/1/PRESS%20RELEASE%20-%20ISRAEL%2025-34%20CN.PDF) of significant arms sales to Israel including weapon systems produced in Camden:

- **155mm artillery rounds** (March 2025: $108.4 million) — General Dynamics Camden produces 155mm projectiles
- **PAC-3 MSE missiles** — Lockheed Martin Camden is the sole U.S. production facility
- **GMLRS rockets** — Lockheed Martin Camden production

### Human Rights Documentation

[Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/03/19/israeli-forces-conduct-gaza) has documented the use of U.S.-supplied weapons in strikes on civilian infrastructure in Gaza, concluding that some attacks "were carried out in apparent violation of the laws of war."

[Amnesty USA](https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/u-s-made-weapons-used-by-government-of-israel-in-violation-of-international-law-and-u-s-law/) has identified specific U.S.-made weapons—including Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs), Hellfire missiles, and 155mm artillery—in attacks on homes, hospitals, and schools, calling for an immediate suspension of arms transfers.

**[Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2009/02/israel-hamas-usaron-armas-extranjeras-contra-civiles-20090220/)** researchers found remnants of U.S.-made **Hellfire missiles**—whose warheads are produced by General Dynamics in Camden—at the sites of attacks in Gaza following the 2008-2009 conflict.

Leading Israeli human rights organizations, including B'Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights Israel, have [concluded](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/07/israel-opt-israeli-organizations-conclude-israel-committing-genocide-against-palestinians-in-gaza-in-another-milestone-for-accountability-efforts/) that the totality of Israel's actions in Gaza—including the widespread bombardment of civilian areas with such munitions—amounts to the crime of genocide.

---

## Conclusion

The evidence assembled here reveals a comprehensive system: an industrial base producing weapons documented in attacks on civilians, sustained by political relationships lubricated by campaign contributions, and protected by legislation that criminalizes dissent.

Arkansas has made a deliberate choice to position itself as a key partner in the maintenance of Israeli military capability. Governor Sanders's "arsenal of democracy" framing is not mere rhetoric—it is an accurate description of operational reality.

The question is whether Arkansas residents, including the teachers whose pension funds are [separately invested](/research/pension-pipeline/) in Israeli bonds, understand what their state's "arsenal" is being used for.

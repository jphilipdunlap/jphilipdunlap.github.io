## A Trust Betrayed

The Arkansas Teacher Retirement System (ATRS) was established with a singular, sacrosanct mission: to provide a secure and dignified retirement for the tens of thousands of educators who have dedicated their careers to the children of Arkansas. Managing a trust of approximately $22 billion, the ATRS Board of Trustees is bound by the highest standards of fiduciary duty—a legal and ethical obligation to act with undivided loyalty and prudence, solely in the financial interest of its members and beneficiaries. This is not merely a guideline; it is the bedrock upon which the entire system rests.

This report, based on an exhaustive review of internal documents, emails, and public records obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, reveals how this sacred trust was betrayed.

On June 2, 2025, the ATRS Board of Trustees made two momentous decisions: it authorized an investment of up to $50 million in Israeli sovereign bonds and approved the hiring of Egan-Jones Proxy Services to manage its shareholder votes. Presented to the public and to the teachers whose life savings were at stake as routine financial matters, these actions were anything but.

The evidence contained in this investigation demonstrates that these decisions were not the product of independent, prudent financial judgment. Instead, they were the calculated culmination of a multi-month political influence campaign orchestrated by external actors with a clear ideological agenda.

## Key Findings

**Political Capture:** The Israel Bond investment was initiated and driven by Arkansas State Auditor Dennis Milligan, an ex-officio ATRS Board member deeply embedded in the State Financial Officers Foundation (SFOF) network. Internal emails show Milligan's office celebrated the vote as a political victory to be "replicated in other states" through the SFOF network.

**Circumvented Due Diligence:** ATRS Board Policy 4 requires that "no investment shall be made without an investment consultant's written advice or written recommendation." This process was completely inverted—the investment was treated as a foregone conclusion, with staff directed to find a manager to implement it rather than evaluate whether it should be made at all.

**Ignored Financial Red Flags:** S&P Global Ratings issued multiple credit downgrades for Israel throughout 2024-2025, citing "heightened geopolitical risks" and a "worsening conflict." These material pecuniary risk factors appear nowhere in the Board's deliberations.

**Weaponized Compliance:** The hiring of Egan-Jones Proxy Services was presented as legal compliance but was actually a strategic maneuver to embed anti-ESG ideology into the system's governance. Egan-Jones's "Wealth-Focused Policy" mandates blanket opposition to shareholder proposals on human rights, climate risk, and corporate accountability—abdicating the Board's duty of case-by-case analysis.

**Coordinated Political Campaign:** Documentary evidence traces a direct pipeline from national SFOF strategy sessions to local Arkansas pension decisions, with Milligan's office serving as the conduit.

### The Smoking Gun

On June 4, 2025, Stacy Peterson, Auditor Milligan's Director of Communications, emailed Adam Schwend at the State Financial Officers Foundation:

> "Feel free to pass along to any member states you think might be interested. The Auditor has very good contacts with the development corporation in case any other states are interested in learning more."

This communication reveals that the Auditor's office viewed the ATRS and APERS investment decisions not as standalone fiduciary actions but as a political victory to be celebrated and replicated. It transforms the ATRS decision from a state-level financial matter into a case study of how a national political network can successfully influence and capture a local public institution.

---

## Chapter 1: The Architect and the Network

The decisions made by the ATRS Board on June 2, 2025, did not arise from an internal, data-driven financial strategy. They were the direct result of a sustained influence campaign waged by a network of political actors operating at both state and national levels.

### The State Financial Officers Foundation

To understand the pressure applied to the ATRS, one must first understand the [State Financial Officers Foundation (SFOF)](https://sfof.com/). While presenting itself as a non-profit educational organization, SFOF functions as a highly active political entity. Its primary mission is to coordinate the actions of "free-market, fiscally conservative statewide elected financial officials" to combat what it labels "woke capitalism," with a specific focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives.

An extensive review of SFOF communications directed to Auditor Milligan's office from late 2024 to mid-2025 reveals a steady drumbeat of political mobilization. SFOF, led by CEO Dr. OJ Oleka and Director of Public Policy Adam Schwend, circulates national sign-on letters targeting federal agencies and major corporations on issues far removed from Arkansas pension management.

For example, a March 26, 2025, letter signed by 24 state officials including Auditor Milligan was sent to the SEC, asset managers, and proxy advisors to "Outline the Risk of DEI Destroying Shareholder Value." Another letter on May 20, 2025, urged the SEC to consider delisting Chinese companies from U.S. exchanges. These actions are coordinated through regular "Policy Zoom" meetings that serve as forums for disseminating strategy and reinforcing ideological agendas.

SFOF is not simply an advocacy group; it is a national coordination hub for political action. It provides state officials like Auditor Milligan with the ideological framework, strategic playbook, and national network required to execute coordinated political agendas at the local level.

### Milligan as Conduit

The documentary evidence—including hundreds of pages of emails and calendar invitations—shows that Auditor Milligan and his senior staff are deeply enmeshed in the SFOF network. They are regular recipients of SFOF's policy directives, frequent attendees at SFOF conferences and policy zooms, and active participants in its letter-writing campaigns.

On March 25, 2025, Jason Brady emailed OJ Oleka directly: "Please add Auditor Milligan to this letter," referring to an SFOF letter condemning "attacks on Tesla." This level of integration demonstrates that the Auditor's office does not merely receive information from SFOF but actively collaborates in its political campaigns.

---

## Chapter 2: Politics Masquerading as Prudence

The ATRS Board's decision to invest $50 million in Israeli sovereign bonds was not the result of rigorous, impartial financial analysis. A chronological reconstruction reveals a process driven from outside by a political actor, advanced despite significant financial risks, and pushed through by circumventing the Board's own due diligence procedures.

### The Political Genesis

The proposal did not originate from ATRS staff or its investment consultant, Aon Hewitt. The entire initiative was conceived and driven by State Auditor Dennis Milligan.

The campaign began on October 23, 2024, with an email from Jason Brady to the executive directors of ATRS and APERS: "On the Auditor's behalf, I am making that request of you," to arrange meetings with Israel Bonds representatives.

Auditor Milligan's motivation was explicitly political. In a draft speech prepared for an October 7, 2024, "Support of Israel" rally, Milligan takes credit for his past efforts:

> "Soon after I took that office back in 2015, I was approached by an Israeli development corporation about the potential of bringing legislation to Arkansas that would allow the state to invest in bonds from Israel. I connected the developers with Sen. Rapert, and through that connection Act 644 was born."

His actions in 2024 and 2025 were a continuation of this long-standing political project, using his position on the ATRS Board as leverage.

### Ignoring Financial Red Flags

While Auditor Milligan was advancing his political agenda, the objective financial landscape for Israeli sovereign debt was deteriorating. A prudent fiduciary, bound by law to consider only "pecuniary factors"—factors having a material effect on financial risk or return—would have found ample reason for caution.

**S&P Global Ratings issued repeated warnings:**

- **April 18, 2024:** S&P [lowered Israel's long-term ratings to 'A+' from 'AA-'](https://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3155269), citing "heightened geopolitical risks" and noting conflicts appeared "set to continue throughout 2024."

- **October 1, 2024:** S&P [lowered the rating again to 'A' from 'A+'](https://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3260102) due to "fallout on Israel's economy and public finances from a worsening conflict" and revised 2024 growth forecasts to 0%.

- **May 9, 2025:** Weeks before the ATRS vote, S&P [affirmed the 'A' rating but maintained a "Negative" outlook](https://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3367190), citing risk that the conflict "could substantially weaken Israel's economy, public finances, and balance-of-payments position."

These repeated warnings are the definition of material pecuniary factors. Yet the extensive documentation for the June 2, 2025, Board meeting contains no evidence these risks were seriously analyzed, debated, or weighed against potential returns.

### Circumventing Due Diligence

ATRS Board Policy 4, the system's Statement of Investment Policy, is unequivocal: **"No investment shall be made without an investment consultant's written advice or written recommendation."** This policy creates a crucial gatekeeping function, ensuring investment decisions are vetted by independent experts before they are put to a vote.

This process was completely inverted.

The June 2, 2025, Investment Committee agenda item for the bond purchase does not include a written recommendation from Aon. Instead, it is framed as a "Consideration of an investment... requested by a member of the ATRS Board." The accompanying recommendation is not to evaluate the prudence of the investment but to hire an external manager to *implement* the mandate.

Mark White's email to the Board confirms this: Aon would provide "advice and materials on how the investment could be structured"—not whether it should be made at all. This inversion of the fiduciary process is the strongest evidence that the decision was driven by political considerations, not impartial analysis.

---

## Chapter 3: The Proxy Ploy

Simultaneous with the bond decision, the ATRS Board voted to fundamentally alter how it exercises its rights as a shareholder. On its face, the decision to hire Egan-Jones Proxy Services was presented as prudent compliance with a new state law. A deeper investigation reveals this move was not a neutral act of compliance but a strategic maneuver to embed a specific political ideology into the system's core governance.

### The Pretext of Compliance

The official rationale was rooted in Act 498 of 2023, codified at [Arkansas Code § 24-2-801 et seq.](https://law.justia.com/codes/arkansas/title-24/chapter-2/subchapter-8/section-24-2-801/) This law mandates that state pension fiduciaries' investment decisions and proxy votes must be based "only upon pecuniary factors"—defined as something with a "material effect on the financial risk or financial return" of an investment.

In a May 22, 2025, memo, ATRS Executive Director Mark White recommended hiring a proxy manager to "ensure consistency across managers in how our proxies are voted, as well as provide greater assurance that our proxy votes are cast in compliance with state law including Act 498."

### Egan-Jones: An Ideological Vehicle

The choice of Egan-Jones reveals the true intent. Of the three leading proxy advisory firms solicited, Egan-Jones stands apart for its explicitly political, anti-ESG stance.

In its proposal to ATRS, Egan-Jones boasts that it is "the only full-service proxy provider that offers an in-house policy which doesn't consider some form of ESG criteria" and that its ["Wealth-Focused Policy"](https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/dam/corp/advocate/investment-stewardship/pdf/investor-choice/egan_jones_wealth_focused_policy.pdf) provides recommendations "based purely on protecting and enhancing shareholder wealth."

The policy document mandates blanket "AGAINST" recommendations for shareholder proposals asking for reports on:

1. Human rights risks
2. Climate lobbying and greenhouse gas emissions
3. Political contributions and lobbying
4. Public health risks
5. Pay equity and DEI practices
6. Operations in high-risk countries

This policy aligns perfectly with SFOF's political agenda. The hiring of Egan-Jones was not a simple vendor choice; it was the selection of an ideological ally whose pre-packaged voting record would ensure ATRS's shareholder power advances SFOF's political goals under the guise of legal compliance.

### The Abdication of Analysis

The most profound failure lies in the abdication of the Board's duty of prudent analysis.

Act 498 does **not** mandate that fiduciaries ignore environmental or social issues. The law explicitly states that an "environmental, social, corporate governance, or other similarly oriented consideration **is a pecuniary factor** if it presents an economic risk or opportunity that a qualified investment professional would treat as a material economic consideration."

True compliance requires case-by-case analysis to determine if a specific social or environmental issue poses a material financial risk. By adopting Egan-Jones's policy, the ATRS Board has contracted out its duty of analysis to a firm whose entire business model is to *not* perform that analysis.

This is not theoretical. The ATRS portfolio contains hundreds of millions of dollars in companies like Boeing and Alphabet (Google), whose operations are the subject of international scrutiny. Reports from the [United Nations](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/report-of-the-independent-international-commission-of-inquiry-on-the-occupied-palestinian-territory-including-east-jerusalem-and-israel-a-hrc-59-26/) and human rights organizations have detailed corporate complicity in human rights violations. A prudent fiduciary has a duty to evaluate whether such issues pose material financial risk. By hiring Egan-Jones, the ATRS Board has chosen institutionalized willful ignorance.

---

## Chapter 4: The Anatomy of a Breach

When measured against the legal standards established in Arkansas statute and the Board's own governing policies, the Board's actions represent a profound, multi-faceted breach of fiduciary duty.

### The Legal Framework

**The Duty of Loyalty:** Trustees must administer the trust solely in the interest of beneficiaries. ATRS Board Policy 4 states: "All transactions undertaken on behalf of the System will be in the sole interest of the System's plan beneficiaries." Actions taken to advance political goals of a trustee or external group violate this duty.

**The Duty of Prudence:** The "Prudent Investor Rule" requires trustees to exercise "reasonable care, skill, and caution." ATRS Board Policy 4 mandates that "Board decisions shall be based on facts and expert opinions."

**The "Pecuniary Factors" Test:** [Arkansas Code § 24-2-804(a)](https://codes.findlaw.com/ar/title-24-retirement-and-pensions/ar-code-sect-24-2-804/) states: "A fiduciary's evaluation of an investment, or evaluation or exercise of any right appurtenant to an investment, shall take into account **only pecuniary factors**." The law explicitly excludes any purpose to further "environmental, social, political, or ideological goals."

### Fiduciary Compliance Analysis

| Duty | Board Action | Analysis |
|:-----|:-------------|:---------|
| **Duty of Loyalty** | Approved $50M Israel Bond investment | Investment was initiated by a political actor for explicitly political reasons, prioritizing non-beneficiary interests over neutral financial evaluation. |
| | Hired Egan-Jones Proxy Services | Selection of a proxy firm with explicit anti-ESG ideology aligns system governance with SFOF's political agenda rather than beneficiaries' sole financial interests. |
| **Duty of Prudence** | Approved $50M Israel Bond investment | Board failed to conduct adequate due diligence, ignoring multiple S&P credit downgrades. Circumvented its own policy requiring written consultant recommendation. |
| | Hired Egan-Jones Proxy Services | Improperly delegated duty of analysis by adopting rigid ideological voting policy that precludes case-by-case evaluation. |
| **Pecuniary Factors Test** | Approved $50M Israel Bond investment | Decision driven by nonpecuniary political purpose, directly violating the statute's prohibition. |
| | Hired Egan-Jones Proxy Services | Adopted policy that willfully ignores duty to evaluate whether social or environmental issues constitute pecuniary factors. |

## Recommendations

### For Accountability

**Investigation by the Arkansas Attorney General:** The evidence of a coordinated political campaign to influence a state pension fund, the apparent violation of state fiduciary laws, and the circumvention of established governance policies warrant formal investigation.

### For Reform

**Strengthen Investment Proposal Policies:** The Board must require that any investment proposed by a Board member—particularly an ex-officio member with external political roles—be subject to mandatory independent fiduciary analysis *before* it can be placed on an agenda.

**Reverse the Egan-Jones Decision:** The Board should immediately reverse its decision to hire Egan-Jones and develop an internal proxy voting policy requiring documented, case-by-case analysis of shareholder proposals.

**Enhance Ethics Rules:** The Arkansas General Assembly and ATRS Board should strengthen conflict-of-interest rules for ex-officio board members to prevent trustees from using their position to advance external political agendas.

---

## Conclusion

The evidence leads to an unequivocal conclusion: the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System has been subjected to a successful political capture campaign.

Under pressure from State Auditor Dennis Milligan and his allies in the State Financial Officers Foundation network, the ATRS Board of Trustees breached its fiduciary duty to the teachers of Arkansas. The decisions on June 2, 2025, to invest $50 million in Israeli sovereign bonds and to hire Egan-Jones Proxy Services were not the product of prudent, independent financial judgment. They were political acts, driven by ideology, that violated the duties of loyalty and prudence and contravened the plain language of Arkansas law.

The retirement security of Arkansas's teachers is not a political football. It is a solemn promise, enshrined in law and backed by a sacred trust. When that trust is breached for political gain, it must be exposed, and accountability must be demanded.

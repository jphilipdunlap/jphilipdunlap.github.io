## The Numbers

**37,000** — Palestinians marked by Lavender as potential assassination targets

**20 seconds** — Reported time human reviewers spent on each target before authorizing strikes

**10%** — Acknowledged error rate, implying approximately **3,700** potential misidentifications

**Gender check** — The primary verification reportedly performed during human review: confirming the target was male

These figures come from multiple Israeli intelligence sources who operated the system, speaking to +972 Magazine and Local Call. The consistency of their accounts, corroborated by Human Rights Watch analysis and observable outcomes in Gaza, forms the evidentiary foundation for this investigation.

## How Lavender Works

Lavender is a machine learning system reportedly developed by Unit 8200, the Israeli military's elite signals intelligence division. Its function: mass identification of individuals for assassination, primarily suspected lower-ranking members of Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad.

### The Training Process

The system was trained by identifying behavioral characteristics of known militants—individuals whose status was previously verified through traditional intelligence methods. These characteristics include:

- Communication patterns (WhatsApp group membership, call frequency with flagged individuals)
- Movement patterns within Gaza
- Social connections and associations
- Presence in certain photographs
- Frequency of changing mobile phones or addresses

Lavender then scans the general population for individuals exhibiting similar patterns.

### Probabilistic Scoring

Each individual receives a score from 1 to 100, indicating the algorithm's confidence that they fit the militant profile. This methodology relies on **correlation rather than causation**—Lavender identifies people who *resemble* militants according to its parameters, not people confirmed to have participated in hostile acts.

The distinction matters: everyday activities in Gaza's densely interconnected society—communicating with neighbors, moving through the strip, being in a WhatsApp group with someone already flagged—can contribute to a "suspicion score" sufficient to place someone on a kill list.

## Operational Deployment: Before and After October 7

Sources describe a significant shift in Lavender's role following October 7, 2023.

### Before: Auxiliary Tool

Prior to October 7, Lavender reportedly functioned as one tool among many, assisting human intelligence analysts in their work. The final determination of targets remained a human-driven process with meaningful verification.

### After: Central Targeting Engine

In the assault on Gaza following October 7, Lavender became the primary mechanism for generating assassination targets. The system transitioned from supporting human analysts to driving the targeting process, with human review reduced to a formality.

Sources describe the result as a **"mass assassination factory"**—the AI generating targets faster than traditional processes could ever achieve, with the military adopting its outputs with minimal scrutiny.

### Scale of Output

The 37,000 individuals marked by Lavender were primarily designated as low-ranking militants. These individuals became potential targets for airstrikes, often executed when they were located in their family homes—a practice facilitated by the companion system known as ["Where's Daddy?"](/research/algorithmic-kill-chain/wheres-daddy/).

This scale—tens of thousands of assassination targets generated by AI—moves far beyond traditional counter-terrorism operations focused on specific, verified threats.

---

## The Collapse of Human Oversight

The Israeli military officially maintains that human operators retain meaningful control over targeting decisions, with AI serving merely as a decision-support tool. Accounts from intelligence personnel describe a different reality.

### The 20-Second Review

Sources report that human intelligence officers often spent approximately 20 seconds reviewing each target dossier produced by Lavender before authorizing a strike. This cursory review was insufficient for independent verification of the AI's assessment.

### The Gender Check

More disturbing: sources claim the primary function of this brief review was often reduced to confirming that the AI-selected target was male. No substantive assessment of the individual's actual status or actions—just verification of gender.

One source described the human role as providing a "rubber stamp" on the machine's recommendation.

### Operational Pressure

The erosion of oversight was driven by operational pressure. The military sought to maximize targets struck during the assault. Lavender offered a solution: AI-generated targets in volumes no human analysis process could match. The incentive structure rewarded speed over verification.

---

## Error Rates and Their Consequences

Intelligence sources acknowledge a **10% error rate** in Lavender's identifications.

On a list of 37,000 individuals, this means approximately **3,700 people** may have been misidentified—placed on a kill list despite lacking the militant affiliations the system was designed to detect.

### What "Error" Means

A Lavender "error" is not a minor administrative mistake. It means:

- An individual was marked for assassination based on algorithmic misidentification
- That individual became a legitimate target under the military's operational rules
- When "Where's Daddy?" tracked that individual to their home, the home became a strike target
- The individual, their family, and anyone nearby faced death based on flawed data

### Acceptable Error?

The military's continued reliance on Lavender despite known error rates suggests an implicit calculation: the volume of targets generated outweighs the cost of killing innocents. A 10% error rate was deemed operationally acceptable.

---

## Legal Analysis: International Humanitarian Law

Lavender's operation raises profound questions under international humanitarian law (IHL), particularly the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precaution.

### Principle of Distinction

IHL requires parties to armed conflict to distinguish between combatants and civilians. Attacks may only target those directly participating in hostilities.

Lavender's methodology inverts this requirement. The system generates probabilistic assessments—likelihood scores—based on behavioral patterns. It does not verify actual participation in hostile acts. Individuals are targeted for *resembling* militants, not for documented hostile conduct.

This conflation of correlation with combatant status fundamentally undermines distinction.

### Principle of Proportionality

Even lawful targets may only be attacked when anticipated military advantage outweighs expected civilian harm.

The 20-second review process provides no meaningful opportunity to assess proportionality for individual strikes. Operators cannot evaluate the military significance of a low-ranking suspected militant against the likely presence of civilians in their home during the brief authorization window.

### Principle of Precautions

Belligerents must take all feasible precautions to minimize civilian harm.

The 20-second review process, focus on speed over accuracy, and explicit acceptance of a 10% error rate demonstrate systematic disregard for precautionary obligations. Meaningful target verification was bypassed in favor of operational tempo.

---

## The Accountability Gap

Lavender creates profound challenges for accountability when targeting errors result in civilian deaths.

### Algorithmic Opacity

The system's decision-making process is opaque. Even operators may not fully understand why a specific individual received a particular probability score. This opacity makes it difficult to assess whether targeting decisions were lawful or to identify responsibility for errors.

### Diffused Responsibility

Responsibility is distributed across:

- The algorithm and its training data
- The human reviewer who spent 20 seconds on verification
- The commander who authorized the strike
- The personnel who executed it
- The developers who created the system

This diffusion makes it difficult to assign responsibility for unlawful killings. Each actor in the chain can point to others.

### Official Denials vs. Operational Reality

The Israeli military officially denies operating an autonomous kill list system, emphasizing that AI tools merely assist human decision-makers and that all targeting complies with IHL.

These official claims lack the granular detail provided by whistleblower accounts and contradict specific operational realities described by sources: the 20-second review times, the gender-check-only verification, the acceptance of significant error rates.

## Evidence Assessment

### Primary Sources

Understanding of Lavender derives primarily from investigative journalism by +972 Magazine and Local Call, based on testimony from multiple Israeli intelligence personnel directly involved with AI targeting systems during the Gaza assault.

The consistency across independent whistleblower accounts—regarding functionality, scale, minimal oversight, and error rates—lends significant credibility to these claims.

### Corroboration

This primary evidence is corroborated by:

- Human Rights Watch analysis of AI targeting in Gaza
- Academic researchers specializing in military technology and IHL
- UN officials expressing alarm over AI use in targeting
- Previous reporting on Israel's "Gospel" system, indicating a trajectory toward automation

### Observable Outcomes

Whistleblower testimony aligns with observable outcomes in Gaza: unprecedented levels of destruction and civilian casualties consistent with a high-volume, low-verification targeting process.

## Implications

Lavender represents something beyond a controversial weapon system or problematic targeting methodology. It embodies a qualitative shift in how states can wage war.

The system enables killing at industrial scale while abstracting the decision-making process. It reduces individuals to probability scores derived from surveillance data. It compresses the timeline for deliberation while expanding the scope of who can be designated for death.

When a 10% error rate on a 37,000-person kill list is deemed acceptable—when 20 seconds of human review suffices to authorize lethal force—the calculus governing violence has fundamentally changed.

The existence and documented use of Lavender underscores the urgent need for:

- International investigation into AI-assisted targeting in Gaza
- Accountability for targeting decisions that violate IHL
- Legal frameworks governing autonomous and AI-enabled weapon systems
- Meaningful requirements for human control over lethal decisions

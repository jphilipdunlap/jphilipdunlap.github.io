## The Automation of Mass Death

Between October 2023 and the present, the Israeli military deployed artificial intelligence systems that fundamentally transformed how targets are selected, tracked, and killed in Gaza. According to intelligence sources who operated these systems, AI generated lists marking as many as **37,000 Palestinians** for potential assassination. Human review of each target allegedly lasted approximately **20 seconds**—primarily to confirm the individual was male. The systems operated with an acknowledged **10% error rate**, meaning thousands of people on these kill lists may have been misidentified.

This is not speculation. These details emerge from whistleblower accounts published by +972 Magazine and Local Call, corroborated by Human Rights Watch investigations, and partially acknowledged by Israeli military officials. The systems have names: **Lavender**, **The Gospel**, **Where's Daddy?**

This investigation traces how these AI systems integrate into a comprehensive technological architecture for automated warfare—from target generation to home surveillance to strike optimization. It documents how global technology corporations, including Google and Amazon through Project Nimbus, provide the computational infrastructure enabling these operations. And it examines what this means for international humanitarian law when algorithms make life-and-death decisions at speeds that preclude meaningful human deliberation.

## The Kill Chain Framework

Military doctrine conceptualizes targeting as a sequential process called the "kill chain": **Find → Fix → Track → Target → Engage → Assess**. Each stage traditionally involves human analysis, verification, and decision-making.

Israel's AI systems automate or accelerate every stage of this chain:

| Kill Chain Stage | Traditional Process | AI System | Reported Function |
|:-----------------|:-------------------|:----------|:------------------|
| **Find** | Human intelligence analysis | Lavender | Generates kill lists of 37,000+ suspected militants from mass surveillance data |
| **Find** (structures) | Analyst identification | The Gospel | Identifies buildings for airstrikes, enabling "hundreds of targets per day" vs. ~50/year manually |
| **Track** | Surveillance teams | Where's Daddy? | Monitors targets' locations, alerts when they enter family homes |
| **Target** | Commander assessment | Fire Factory | Calculates munitions, optimizes strike scheduling, prioritizes targets |
| **Engage** | Pilot/operator | Fire Weaver | Accelerates sensor-to-shooter cycle, potentially autonomous engagement |

The cumulative effect: a system designed to generate and execute targets at scales and speeds previously impossible, compressing the timeline for human oversight while expanding the scope of who and what can be destroyed.

## Identified Systems

### Targeting Systems

**Lavender** — An AI system that analyzes behavioral patterns from mass surveillance to generate lists of suspected militants for assassination. Sources report it marked up to 37,000 Palestinians, operated with minimal human review (~20 seconds per target), and had an acknowledged 10% error rate. Intelligence personnel described acting as a "rubber stamp" on machine decisions.

**The Gospel (Habsora)** — AI that identifies structural targets—buildings, infrastructure, residences—for airstrikes. Former IDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kohavi stated it generates hundreds of targets daily compared to approximately 50 per year through traditional analysis. Sources described the result as a "mass assassination factory."

**Where's Daddy?** — A tracking system that monitors individuals already marked for assassination, alerting operators when targets enter their family homes. This operationalizes a policy of striking people surrounded by their families, with predictable mass civilian casualties.

### Surveillance Infrastructure

**Red Wolf / Blue Wolf / Wolf Pack** — Facial recognition systems deployed at West Bank checkpoints and via soldier smartphones. Amnesty International documented these as tools of "automated apartheid," creating biometric databases of the Palestinian population to enforce movement restrictions and segregation.

**Pegasus** — Military-grade spyware developed by NSO Group and licensed by the Israeli government. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International documented its deployment against Palestinian human rights defenders, enabling deep surveillance of civil society.

### Enabling Infrastructure

**Project Nimbus** — A $1.2 billion contract providing Google and Amazon cloud infrastructure and AI services to the Israeli government and military. Capabilities potentially include facial detection, object tracking, and sentiment analysis. The "No Tech for Apartheid" campaign has organized sustained protests by tech workers opposing corporate complicity.

**Unit 8200 LLM** — A large language model reportedly in development, trained on intercepted Palestinian communications. Potential applications include accelerating intelligence analysis and enabling more comprehensive population surveillance.

## The Investigation Series

This multi-part investigation examines each component of Israel's AI warfare ecosystem, analyzing available evidence, assessing legal implications under international humanitarian law, and tracing connections to global corporate infrastructure.

### [Part 1: Lavender](./lavender/)
**The AI Kill List Generator**

How a machine learning system marked 37,000 Palestinians for potential assassination based on behavioral patterns, operating with 20-second human review and a 10% error rate. Analysis of what it means to target people based on algorithmic probability rather than evidence of hostile acts.

### [Part 2: The Gospel](./gospel/)
**The Mass Assassination Factory**

How AI-driven structural targeting enabled the systematic destruction of Gaza's urban infrastructure at unprecedented speed and scale. Examination of the shift from 50 targets per year to hundreds per day, and the consequences for civilian protection.

### [Part 3: Where's Daddy?](./wheres-daddy/)
**Weaponizing the Domestic Sphere**

How a tracking system transformed family homes into preferred kill zones, operationalizing a policy that routinely results in the deaths of entire families. Analysis of what it means to develop technology specifically designed to strike people surrounded by their children.

### [Part 4: Automated Apartheid](./facial-recognition/)
**The Infrastructure of Automated Apartheid**

How Red Wolf, Blue Wolf, and related systems create a biometric control apparatus in the occupied territories—and how surveillance data collected for "routine" population control feeds into lethal targeting systems.

### [Part 5: Support Systems](./support-systems/)
**The Corporate Architecture of Algorithmic Warfare**

How Fire Factory optimizes strikes, Project Nimbus provides computational backbone, Pegasus enables deep surveillance, and Unit 8200's LLM processes intercepted communications. Tracing corporate complicity from Silicon Valley to Gaza.

### [Part 6: Synthesis](./synthesis/)
**Conclusions and Accountability**

Cumulative assessment of AI's role in alleged war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Analysis of the accountability gap created by algorithmic decision-making and recommendations for international response.

## Connection to Related Investigations

This investigation is part of a broader documentation project tracing the architecture of U.S.-Israel military cooperation and its human consequences.

**[The Arkansas Arsenal](/research/arkansas-arsenal/)** traces the supply chain from Camden, Arkansas defense manufacturing to documented civilian casualties in Gaza—the physical weapons that AI systems direct toward targets.

**[The Pension Pipeline](/research/pension-pipeline/)** documents how Arkansas state pension systems invested $157 million in Israel Bonds while circumventing fiduciary procedures, revealing the financial mechanisms that sustain these operations.

The Algorithmic Kill Chain completes the picture: weapons flow from Arkansas factories, financed by American pension funds, deployed by AI systems that generate targets faster than humans can verify them. This is the infrastructure of complicity.

## Methodology and Sources

This investigation synthesizes:

- **Whistleblower accounts** published by +972 Magazine, Local Call, and The Guardian from intelligence personnel who operated these systems
- **Human rights documentation** from Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and B'Tselem
- **Legal analysis** from the Lieber Institute, Opinio Juris, and international law scholars
- **Technical reporting** on AI capabilities and limitations
- **Corporate disclosures** regarding Project Nimbus and related contracts

Where official Israeli sources have acknowledged or disputed specific claims, those positions are noted. Where information comes from anonymous intelligence sources, the credibility and corroboration of those accounts is assessed.

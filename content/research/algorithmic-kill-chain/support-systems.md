## The Numbers

**$1.2 billion** — Value of Project Nimbus, the Google-Amazon cloud contract providing AI infrastructure to the Israeli military

**100 billion words** — Volume of intercepted Palestinian communications used to train Unit 8200's surveillance language model

**6** — Palestinian human rights defenders confirmed hacked by Pegasus spyware before Israel designated their organizations as "terrorist"

**28+** — Google and Amazon workers fired for protesting Project Nimbus

**"Seconds rather than minutes"** — Fire Weaver's sensor-to-shooter acceleration, per Rafael marketing materials

**$33 million** — RTX-Rafael facility in Camden, Arkansas producing Iron Dome missiles

---

The targeting systems documented in this series—[Gospel](/research/algorithmic-kill-chain/gospel/), [Lavender](/research/algorithmic-kill-chain/lavender/), and [Where's Daddy?](/research/algorithmic-kill-chain/wheres-daddy/)—do not operate in isolation. They depend on a vast supporting infrastructure: cloud computing platforms that process surveillance data, decision support systems that translate AI recommendations into bombing raids, spyware that penetrates the devices of human rights defenders, and language models trained on the intercepted conversations of an occupied population.

This infrastructure is not incidental. It is the foundation upon which automated warfare operates. Without Google and Amazon cloud services, the machine learning systems identifying targets could not function at scale. Without Fire Factory, AI-generated target lists would remain abstractions rather than scheduled airstrikes. Without Pegasus, the intelligence apparatus would lose its capacity to monitor those documenting its crimes.

The corporations and state agencies building this infrastructure are not passive contractors. They are architects of a system designed to surveil, target, and eliminate.

## Fire Factory: The Mass Assassination Scheduler

Fire Factory transforms AI-generated target lists into operational bombing campaigns. Taking outputs from systems like Gospel (structural targets) and Lavender (individual targets), it calculates required munition loads, prioritizes targets, assigns specific targets to aircraft and drones, and proposes attack schedules.

The system functions as logistical infrastructure for aerial bombardment at industrial scale. As one intelligence source described the Gaza operations: a "mass assassination factory."

Dr. Tal Mimran, a legal scholar who has studied these systems, describes the operational flow:

> "Fire Factory evaluates and categorizes information into possible threats or targets, acting as a bridge between data collection [Alchemist] and target selection [Gospel]."

The system reportedly processes "military-approved targets"—but the nature of AI target generation means Fire Factory schedules strikes based on data from systems like Lavender, which intelligence sources say operated with a documented error rate and permissive rules of engagement accepting up to 20 civilian casualties per junior militant.

Fire Factory may incorporate automated Rules of Engagement and Collateral Damage Estimation calculations. The reliability and ethical thresholds embedded within these assessments remain opaque. What is observable is output: the systematic bombardment of residential buildings, the destruction of entire neighborhoods, the "where's daddy?" timing of strikes to maximize deaths when families gather.

The system's lack of direct connection to deployed weapons does not insulate it from responsibility. Fire Factory occupies a critical node in a system designed for automated mass killing. It accelerates the pathway from algorithmic target identification to lethal strike, reducing the time and opportunity for human ethical judgment.

---

## Fire Weaver: Sensor to Shooter in Seconds

Fire Weaver, developed by Rafael (the same state-owned company producing Iron Dome components in Arkansas), provides networked communication between sensors and shooters, dramatically accelerating engagement.

The system is designed to:

- Connect surveillance platforms (drones, satellites, ground sensors) directly to weapons systems
- Fuse data from multiple sources to create unified targeting pictures
- Reduce the "sensor-to-shooter" loop from minutes to seconds
- Enable rapid engagement of targets identified by other AI systems

Rafael marketing materials boast of response times measured in "seconds rather than minutes."

This acceleration has profound legal implications. International humanitarian law requires assessment of distinction and proportionality before each attack. When Fire Weaver compresses engagement timelines to seconds, it eliminates the temporal space for meaningful human deliberation—transferring effective decision-making authority to the machine.

The system has been deployed operationally, including during the 2021 assault on Gaza, providing real-time targeting data integration. Its current role in the post-October 7 operations is presumed but not independently confirmed.

## Project Nimbus: Silicon Valley's Infrastructure for Occupation

Project Nimbus is a $1.2 billion contract awarded in 2021 to Google and Amazon to provide cloud computing and artificial intelligence services to the Israeli government and military.

### Capabilities

The contract reportedly provides:

- Scalable cloud computing infrastructure
- Data storage and processing
- AI and machine learning tools
- Potentially including: facial detection, object tracking, image labeling, sentiment analysis, and automated content tagging

These capabilities align directly with the requirements of systems like Gospel, Lavender, and the Unit 8200 LLM. Mass surveillance generates massive datasets; mass datasets require massive cloud infrastructure; cloud infrastructure enables the AI systems identifying targets.

### The Corporate Response

Despite documentation of the contract's military applications and sustained protests by tech workers, Google and Amazon maintain their participation.

Google maintains the contract is not directed at "highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services"—a claim contradicted by Israeli government statements and documented military use of cloud services.

Both companies have retaliated against protesting workers. **Twenty-eight employees were fired** following sit-ins and demonstrations organized by No Tech For Apartheid. The firings demonstrate a deliberate choice to protect contracts over ethical responsibility, prioritizing profit from a regime engaged in systematic violence.

## Pegasus: Surveillance as Counter-Accountability

Pegasus, developed by Israeli cyber-arms firm NSO Group, represents the surveillance apparatus's reach into the most private digital spaces of those documenting its crimes. Marketed for fighting crime and terrorism, it has been systematically deployed against Palestinian human rights defenders, journalists, lawyers, and activists.

### Technical Capabilities

Pegasus is designed for covert, remote installation on iOS and Android devices using sophisticated "zero-click" exploits requiring no target interaction. Once installed, the spyware can:

- Access all data on the device (messages, emails, contacts, photos, files)
- Activate the microphone and camera for real-time surveillance
- Track location
- Intercept encrypted communications (WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram)
- Extract passwords and credentials

The spyware provides essentially total access to a target's digital life—and by extension, to their networks, sources, and confidential communications.

### Palestinian Targets

In November 2021, Citizen Lab and Front Line Defenders confirmed Pegasus infections on devices belonging to **six Palestinian human rights defenders**:

- Salah Hammouri (lawyer, Addameer)
- Ubai Aboudi (director, Bisan Center for Research and Development)
- Ghassan Halaika (researcher, Al-Haq)
- Three additional individuals with connections to Al-Haq and Addameer

Just two weeks after this disclosure, Israel's Ministry of Defense designated six Palestinian civil society organizations—including Al-Haq and Addameer—as "terrorist organizations." The timing is not coincidental. Surveillance was used to gather information supporting the designations—a move widely condemned as an attack on Palestinian civil society and an attempt to suppress human rights monitoring.

Subsequent investigations revealed Pegasus targeting of Palestinian-American journalist Daoud Kuttab multiple times between 2022 and 2023.

### State Licensing

Pegasus export is explicitly subject to licensing by the Israeli Ministry of Defense, establishing a direct link between the state and proliferation of this repressive technology. The licensing regime underscores the strategic use of cyber-surveillance as an instrument of Israeli statecraft.

The U.S. government blacklisted NSO Group in November 2021 for facilitating transnational repression. Israel continues to oversee its operations. Pegasus is not merely a private company's product—it is an extension of the Israeli state's surveillance apparatus, deployed against Palestinians and exported globally as a tool of control.

## Unit 8200 LLM: Training AI on the Language of the Occupied

The Israeli military's intelligence apparatus—specifically the elite cyber warfare Unit 8200—is developing an AI tool based on Large Language Model technology, similar to ChatGPT. This represents a significant escalation: moving beyond target identification toward analyzing and potentially manipulating the language and communication of the Palestinian population.

### Training Data: 100 Billion Words of Intercepted Conversations

Unlike publicly available LLMs trained on internet data, Unit 8200's model is being fed vast quantities of intercepted Palestinian communications—millions of telephone conversations and text messages captured through Israel's pervasive surveillance infrastructure.

> Sources indicate the model was trained on as much as **100 billion words of Arabic**, including everyday, personal conversations with no inherent intelligence value, harvested specifically because they provide rich data on spoken dialects unavailable elsewhere.

This mass interception and instrumentalization of private communications from an occupied population—not suspected of any crime—constitutes a severe violation of fundamental privacy and digital rights.

### Applications: Prediction, Incrimination, Control

The Unit 8200 LLM is designed to:

- Rapidly process surveillance data to "answer questions" about individuals
- Generate summaries of relationships, activities, and sentiments from private communications
- Identify keywords or expressions of dissent ("troublemaking" words)
- Accelerate identification of individuals for incrimination and arrest

Intelligence sources explicitly state that such AI tools amplify state power, enabling broader population control by facilitating the tracking of human rights activists, monitoring construction in Area C, and providing deeper insight into the lives of Palestinians under occupation.

Unit 8200 already utilizes smaller language models for classification, transcription, and translation—systems that sources say have deepened control and increased arrests by allowing commanders access to translated intelligence without Arabic language skills. The new, larger LLM scales these capabilities dramatically.

### Corporate Expertise

The involvement of Israeli military reservists possessing expertise gained at **Google, Meta, and Microsoft** in developing this LLM raises serious questions about tech industry complicity in building surveillance tools. These companies have employed individuals who subsequently contribute specialized knowledge to systems designed for population control and incrimination.

An LLM trained predominantly on the language of a population living under decades of military occupation is likely to internalize and reproduce biases, misinterpreting cultural expressions, frustration, or political dissent as indicators of threat. As Human Rights Watch notes, LLMs function like "guessing machines"—and their inherent errors, coupled with user over-trust, create significant risks of misidentification and wrongful incrimination.

## The Integrated Architecture

These systems do not operate independently. They form an integrated, mutually reinforcing ecosystem designed to maximize surveillance, control, and the application of lethal force.

**Project Nimbus** serves as the foundational layer—providing computational power, data storage, and AI/ML tools. The massive datasets generated by surveillance infrastructure require scalable cloud services for storage, processing, and analysis. This infrastructure enables Gospel, Lavender, and the Unit 8200 LLM.

**Intelligence gathering**—through Pegasus compromising individual devices, mass interception feeding the Unit 8200 LLM, and conventional surveillance—flows into the broader intelligence pool.

**AI systems** (Alchemist, Gospel, Lavender) process this intelligence, identifying threats, generating targets, and detecting patterns.

**Fire Factory** takes AI-generated target lists and automates bombardment logistics—calculating munitions, scheduling strikes.

**Fire Weaver** connects sensors directly to shooters at the tactical level, accelerating engagement based on real-time data.

**Edge 360** provides platform-level threat detection for vehicles operating within this environment.

The result is a cycle: surveillance feeds AI analysis, which directs and accelerates military action, enabled by corporate cloud infrastructure. The components are interdependent. Remove the cloud computing and the AI systems cannot operate at scale. Remove the targeting systems and the decision support tools have nothing to schedule. Remove the surveillance and the entire apparatus loses its inputs.

This is not a collection of tools. It is an architecture—a designed system where each component reinforces the others, creating a machine for automated control and killing.

---

## Human Rights Framework

The systems documented here raise fundamental questions under international humanitarian and human rights law.

### Privacy and Digital Rights

The mass interception of Palestinian communications—feeding both the Unit 8200 LLM and broader intelligence systems—violates the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Article 17, which prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, and correspondence.

Pegasus targeting of human rights defenders violates protections for freedom of expression (ICCPR Article 19) and association (Article 22), creating surveillance that chills legitimate civil society activity.

### Civilian Distinction and Proportionality

The decision support systems that accelerate targeting—Fire Factory scheduling strikes, Fire Weaver reducing engagement time to seconds—operate within a framework where documented error rates and permissive collateral damage thresholds suggest systematic failure to distinguish combatants from civilians.

When Fire Factory schedules strikes based on Lavender's outputs—a system sources say accepted error rates and civilian casualty ratios that permitted killing uninvolved family members—the automation does not remove responsibility. It distributes it across a system designed to minimize deliberation.

### Corporate Complicity

Under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, corporations have a responsibility to respect human rights, including conducting due diligence to identify and address adverse impacts.

Google and Amazon's provision of cloud infrastructure enabling these systems—despite documented military use, worker protests, and human rights organization warnings—constitutes a failure of due diligence. The retaliatory firing of workers who raised these concerns demonstrates active resistance to accountability.

NSO Group's licensing by the Israeli Ministry of Defense and documented use of Pegasus against human rights defenders establishes corporate complicity in surveillance that facilitates persecution of civil society.

## Evidence Assessment

This analysis relies on a combination of investigative journalism, human rights documentation, and corporate/government disclosures.

### Strengths

- +972 Magazine and Local Call investigations based on direct sources within Israeli intelligence
- Citizen Lab forensic analysis of Pegasus infections—technically verified
- Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International documentation
- Corporate acknowledgment of Project Nimbus (though disputes over scope)
- Rafael marketing materials describing Fire Weaver capabilities

### Limitations

- Precise operational details of Fire Factory and Fire Weaver remain classified
- Unit 8200 LLM reporting based on limited sources
- Direct confirmation of Project Nimbus use for specific targeting systems unavailable

### Assessment

The combination of whistleblower testimony, forensic analysis, corporate disclosures, and observable outcomes provides substantial evidence of an integrated surveillance and targeting infrastructure. Specific technical details may be incomplete, but the overall architecture—and the corporate complicity enabling it—is well-documented.

Official Israeli government statements about system capabilities should be treated as self-serving but useful for understanding official narratives.

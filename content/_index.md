I'm a FOIA researcher and policy analyst based in Arkansas. The work here focuses on institutional accountability—tracing money, documenting relationships, asking questions that can be answered with evidence.

## Featured Work

### [The Cost of the Alliance](/research/cost-of-the-alliance/)
An analysis of how U.S.-Israel policy materializes in American communities: the domestic costs, political mechanisms, and local consequences that rarely make it into foreign policy discussions.

### [The Algorithmic Kill Chain](/research/algorithmic-kill-chain/)
A six-part investigation into Israeli AI targeting systems—Lavender, Gospel, and Where's Daddy—examining how automation has reshaped warfare in Gaza.

### [The Pension Pipeline](/research/pension-pipeline/)
Documenting Arkansas's $145 million investment in Israel Bonds, exploring how state pension systems create financial connections to foreign policy.

### [The Arkansas Arsenal](/research/arkansas-arsenal/)
Tracing Camden's defense manufacturing hub and its supply chain connections to weapons documented in use in Gaza.

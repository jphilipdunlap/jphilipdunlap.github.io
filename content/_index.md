I investigate how public institutions fail the people they're meant to serve.

My work combines FOIA research, policy analysis, and primary source documentation to trace the mechanisms of institutional capture—from Arkansas pension funds investing $157 million in foreign securities with documented procedural violations, to defense industry supply chains connecting local manufacturing to international conflict.

I'm a member of Little Rock Peace for Palestine, where I conduct investigative research on state complicity and develop FOIA resources for activist organizations.

## Featured Work

**[The Pension Pipeline](/research/pension-pipeline/)** — A forensic investigation into Arkansas state pension investments in Israel Bonds, documenting $157 million in purchases, procedural violations, and political capture of fiduciary institutions.

I'm a FOIA researcher and policy analyst based in Arkansas. My work focuses on institutional accountability—tracing the financial flows, political networks, and policy mechanisms that connect local institutions to broader systems of power.

I build evidentiary records from primary sources: board documents, internal correspondence, campaign finance data, government disclosures. The goal is documentation rigorous enough to support legal scrutiny and transform advocacy from assertion into evidence.

I'm looking to do this work professionally—legal research, policy analysis, that direction.

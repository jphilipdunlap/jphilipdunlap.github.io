I investigate how public institutions fail the people they're meant to serve.

My work combines FOIA research, policy analysis, and primary source documentation to trace the mechanisms of institutional capture—from Arkansas pension systems investing $157 million in foreign securities with documented procedural violations, to defense industry supply chains connecting local manufacturing to documented violations of international humanitarian law.

I'm a member of Little Rock Peace for Palestine, where I conduct investigative research on state complicity and develop FOIA resources for activist organizations.

## Featured Work

**[The Algorithmic Kill Chain](/research/algorithmic-kill-chain/)** — A six-part investigation documenting Israeli AI targeting systems deployed in Gaza, from mass target generation (Lavender) to automated home tracking (Where's Daddy?) to the corporate infrastructure enabling it all.

**[The Pension Pipeline](/research/pension-pipeline/)** — A forensic investigation into Arkansas state pension investments in Israel Bonds, documenting procedural violations and political capture of fiduciary institutions.

**[The Arkansas Arsenal](/research/arkansas-arsenal/)** — Mapping the supply chain from Camden's defense manufacturing hub to documented civilian casualties, including $133,500 in defense PAC contributions to Arkansas's federal delegation.

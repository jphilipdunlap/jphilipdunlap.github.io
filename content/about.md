I'm Joshua Dunlap, an independent researcher based in North Little Rock, Arkansas. I investigate institutional accountability failures through FOIA research, policy analysis, and primary source documentation.

## What I Do

My primary focus is documenting how public institutions—pension systems, state agencies, legislative bodies—become captured by interests that conflict with their stated missions. This work requires handling voluminous records, identifying procedural violations, and translating complex regulatory frameworks into clear findings.

My flagship investigation, "The Pension Pipeline," documents how Arkansas pension systems invested $157 million in Israel Bonds while appearing to violate their own investment policies. The research draws on FOIA requests, board meeting minutes, statutory analysis, and financial disclosures to build a comprehensive evidentiary record.

I've also developed FOIA training materials—including guides to federal and Arkansas public records law—designed to help activist organizations use disclosure requests as tools for accountability campaigns.

## Why This Work Matters

Public records exist because democracy requires transparency. When pension boards invest teachers' retirement funds in ways that may violate fiduciary duties, the public has a right to know. When state agencies claim exemptions from disclosure, someone needs to push back.

I do this work because I believe rigorous documentation—the kind that would hold up in a legal proceeding—is the foundation of meaningful accountability. Advocacy without evidence is just noise. Evidence without clear communication sits in file folders. The goal is both: build the record, then make it legible.

## Background

I'm a father, a partner, and a member of Little Rock Peace for Palestine.

      <p>I work in customer care—benefits administration, helping people navigate disability claims and medical leave. The work means parsing regulations, building documentation for contested cases, and translating bureaucratic language for people facing real deadlines.</p>
      
      <p>The research on this site is something I do on my own time, mostly through my involvement with Little Rock Peace for Palestine. I got into it because I wanted to contribute something beyond showing up at demonstrations, and it turned out that digging through public records and building documentation was something I could actually do well. So I kept doing it.</p>
      
      <p>I care about getting things right. If I can't verify something through public records, it doesn't go in the work. That's not a sales pitch—it's just how I think research should be done.</p>
      
      <p>Eventually I'd like to do this kind of work professionally. Legal research, policy work, something in that direction. For now, it's what I do evenings and weekends because I think it matters.</p>
      
      <p>If you want to talk about any of the work here, or if you're interested in collaborating on something, feel free to reach out.</p>
